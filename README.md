# ‚ú® Overview

> The v2023.0.0 release for the GEM's global seismic risk profiles is now available! ü•≥ üöÄ

This repository hosts the global seismic risk profiles for the world. These seismic risk profiles have been produced with the outputs from the 2023 Global Seismic Risk Model of the GEM Foundation. Useful information about the underlying datasets and overall methodology can be found in the [Global Seismic Risk Model documentation](https://docs.openquake.org/global_risk_model/).


# üöÄ Model versions  

Each version of the model that is released can be accessed by changing from the `master` branch to the `tag` of a given version.
The `master` branch could contain the work-in-progress of the next version of the model.

| Version   | Release Notes                                                            |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| v2018.0.0 | Original version within the larger 2018 Global Risk Model release.       |
| [v2023.0.0](https://github.com/gem/risk-profiles/tree/v2023.0.0) | Release of the Global Risk Model (June 2023). This uses the exposure version `v2023.1.0`, vulnerability version `v2023.0.0`, and the relevant hazard mosaic versions indicated per the global hazard map `v2023.1`. |

Note that the risk version is not 1:1 with the versioning of the underpinning hazard, exposure, and vulnerability model inputs used.

# üåç Region and country list

# üìã Explanation of profile content

The GEM Foundation has produced a collection of Country/Territory Seismic Risk Profiles that summarize key metrics of seismic risk, allowing stakeholders in risk management to get an overview of the risk in a region at-a-glance. Each profile presents the following relevant information:

* Social indicators, which provide context to the region in question 
* Risk indicators, detailing an occupancy breakdown of exposed value and losses
* A list of the major earthquakes that have impacted the region
* Loss per region, providing a breakdown of average annual losses per administrative level 1
* Building classes, depicting the major construction materials used in the region
* Loss curves, which provide expected losses per different return periods
* Maps depicting the geographical distribution of hazard, exposure, and losses

The risk values presented are the results of an event-based risk analysis, where 100,000 years of earthquakes are simulated. Three lines of business are considered: residential, commercial, and industrial. Therefore, the value or earthquake losses from damage to other building occupancies (e.g., schools, healthcare) and infrastructure are not included.
